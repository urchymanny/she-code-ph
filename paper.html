    <p class="para quoted">
      The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like
      nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and
      computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
      The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism
      for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and
      interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for
      geographic location. The Internet represents one of the most successful
      examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment to
      research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the
      early research in packet switching, the government, industry and academia
      have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology.
      Today, terms like “bleiner@computer.org” and “http://www.acm.org” trip
      lightly off the tongue of the random person on the street.

    <p class="para">
      This is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete
      history. Much material currently exists about the Internet, covering
      history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find
      shelves of material written about the Internet.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
      In this paper,3 several of us involved in the development and evolution of
      the Internet share our views of its origins and history. This history
      revolves around four distinct aspects. There is the technological
      evolution that began with early research on packet switching and the
      ARPANET (and related technologies), and where current research continues
      to expand the horizons of the infrastructure along several dimensions,
      such as scale, performance, and higher-level functionality. There is the
      operations and management aspect of a global and complex operational
      infrastructure. There is the social aspect, which resulted in a broad
      community of Internauts working together to create and evolve the
      technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in an
      extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed
      and available information infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p class="para summary">
      The Internet today is a widespread information infrastructure, the initial
      prototype of what is often called the National (or Global or Galactic)
      Information Infrastructure. Its history is complex and involves many
      aspects - technological, organizational, and community. And its influence
      reaches not only to the technical fields of computer communications but
      throughout society as we move toward increasing use of online tools to
      accomplish electronic commerce, information acquisition, and community
      operations.

      The first recorded description of the social interactions that could be
      enabled through networking was a series of memos written by J.C.R.
      Licklider of MIT in August 1962 discussing his “Galactic Network” concept.
      He envisioned a globally interconnected set of computers through which
      everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site. In spirit,
      the concept was very much like the Internet of today. Licklider was the
      first head of the computer research program at DARPA,4 starting in October
      1962. While at DARPA he convinced his successors at DARPA, Ivan
      Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts, of the
      importance of this networking concept.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      Leonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching
      theory in July 1961 and the first book on the subject in 1964. Kleinrock
      convinced Roberts of the theoretical feasibility of communications using
      packets rather than circuits, which was a major step along the path
      towards computer networking. The other key step was to make the computers
      talk together. To explore this, in 1965 working with Thomas Merrill,
      Roberts connected the TX-2 computer in Mass. to the Q-32 in California
      with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating the first (however small)
      wide-area computer network ever built. The result of this experiment was
      the realization that the time-shared computers could work well together,
      running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the remote machine,
      but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally inadequate for
      the job. Kleinrock’s conviction of the need for packet switching was
      confirmed.

    <p class="para">
      In late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept
      and quickly put together his plan for the “ARPANET”, publishing it in
      1967. At the conference where he presented the paper, there was also a
      paper on a packet network concept from the UK by Donald Davies and Roger
      Scantlebury of NPL. Scantlebury told Roberts about the NPL work as well as
      that of Paul Baran and others at RAND. The RAND group had written a paper
      on packet switching networks for secure voice in the military in 1964. It
      happened that the work at MIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at NPL
      (1964-1967) had all proceeded in parallel without any of the researchers
      knowing about the other work. The word “packet” was adopted from the work
      at NPL and the proposed line speed to be used in the ARPANET design was
      upgraded from 2.4 kbps to 50 kbps.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      In August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined
      the overall structure and specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was
      released by DARPA for the development of one of the key components, the
      packet switches called Interface Message Processors (IMP’s).
    </p>
    <p class="para summary">
      The RFQ was won in December 1968 by a group headed by Frank Heart at Bolt
      Beranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team worked on the IMP’s with Bob
      Kahn playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design, the
      network topology and economics were designed and optimized by Roberts
